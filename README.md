## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/pranjulagrawal9/Bitebox/blob/main/Bitebox.gif)

• Bitebox is a web application which lists all the restaurants and their
menus available near a user’s location.

• It is using Swiggy’s public API to fetch real restaurants data.
• Leveraged Geolocation API and Geocoding API for getting user’s
location coordinates and address.

• Effectively implemented a search feature for filtering out restaurants,
utilizing the debouncing technique to enhance user experience and
optimize performance.

• Implemented code splitting and lazy loading to improve applications’s
initial load time.
